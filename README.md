# Churn Prediction
 My First ML Project

#### Project descriptionA Bank wants to take care of customer retention for its product: savings accounts. The bank wants you to identify customers likely to churn balances below the minimum balance. You have the customers information such as age, gender, demographics along with their transactions with the bank.
#### Churn here means whether the person will leave the Bank's product or not
